# Jar's G13 Actionbars  

This is a bespoke action bar layout for users of the Logitech G13. 

It of course can be used as a standard actiobar addon, but the layout has specific emphasis in how the action buttons are laid out. 

The view is statically set for:

<img width="482" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92b25137-35bc-43d0-9020-16acee7fe0fa" />

This cannot be changed. The layout losely matches the Logitech G13

<img width="325" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea94f12f-fe9a-4f31-9a9f-ce6dcc202d75" />

Often, the 6 central buttons are the primary buttons used, whereas the outside buttons are less often used. 

I have extra slots to accomodate mouse buttons also, for easy binding. 

This is 100% a pet project for a very specific use-case. BUT, it does also double as a general-purpose lightweight Action Bar mod. It still has a clean look with large/medium/small action buttons. 

## Configuration

`/jg13` will open a configuration screen.

Again, this is locked to the center of the screen, but you can use the slider to move it along the vertical axis. 

## Notes:

Mounting a, well, mount swaps to Action ar Page 6. So you will want to set your flying controls to this action set.
